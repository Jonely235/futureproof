<objective>
Organize imports consistently across all Dart files following Flutter/Dart conventions.

Purpose: Ensure consistent, maintainable import order that follows community standards and improves code readability.
Output: All lib/ Dart files have organized imports with proper grouping and formatting.

# Auto-selected based on dependency graph (from frontmatter):

# Key files from frontmatter (relevant to this phase):
@lib/screens/home_screen.dart
@lib/screens/settings_screen.dart
@lib/services/analytics_service.dart
@lib/providers/transaction_provider.dart
@lib/widgets/bar_chart_widget.dart

**Tech stack available:** dart, flutter
**Established patterns:** Import order: 1) Flutter framework, 2) Package imports, 3) Relative imports
**Constraining decisions:**
- [Phase 2-01]: Use lowerCamelCase naming for constants (consistent pattern)
- [Phase 4-04]: Settings screen refactor complete (220 lines, 4 widgets extracted)

**Issues being addressed:** Import order inconsistency noted in CONCERNS.md (import order sensitivity)

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Analyze current import patterns across all files</name>
  <files>lib/**/*.dart</files>
  <action>Scan all lib/ Dart files to document current import patterns. Check:
1. Import order (flutter SDK, packages, relative)
2. Organization within groups (alphabetical, random)
3. Import alias usage (as model, as service)
4. Unused imports
5. dart: imports vs package: imports

DO NOT modify any files yet - only analyze and document findings.</action>
  <verify>Run find command to scan all files, produce summary report of import patterns found</verify>
  <done>Summary document listing: current import patterns, inconsistencies found, files needing fixes</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Standardize import order in all lib/ files</name>
  <files>lib/**/*.dart</files>
  <action>Organize imports in every Dart file to match Flutter convention:

**Order:**
1. `dart:` imports (if any)
2. `package:flutter` SDK imports
3. Third-party package imports (provider, shared_preferences, google_fonts, etc.)
4. Relative imports (../models/, ../services/, ../widgets/, etc.)

**Within each group:**
- Alphabetical order
- One blank line between groups

**Run dart fix:** `dart fix --apply` to auto-format imports

**Files to process:** All files in lib/ directory

Import aliases (like `import '../models/transaction.dart' as model`) should be preserved if used to avoid naming conflicts.</action>
  <verify>`dart format .` runs successfully with no changes suggested (imports are properly formatted)</verify>
  <done>All lib/ files have organized imports following: dart: → flutter → packages → relative (alphabetical within groups)</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Verify imports work after reorganization</name>
  <files>lib/**/*.dart</files>
  <action>Run analysis to ensure no import-related errors after reorganization:

1. Run `dart analyze` - should exit with 0 (no issues)
2. Check for "unused import" warnings
3. Check for "ambiguous import" errors
4. Verify app compiles: `dart build` or flutter build

If any errors found, fix the specific import issues (remove unused imports, resolve conflicts, add missing exports).

DO NOT commit until dart analyze passes cleanly.</action>
  <verify>`dart analyze` exits with code 0 and reports "no issues found"</verify>
  <done>All imports resolved, no unused imports, app compiles successfully</done>
</task>

</tasks>

Before declaring plan complete:
- [ ] All lib/ files have organized imports
- [ ] Import order follows: dart: → flutter → packages → relative
- [ ] Groups are alphabetically sorted
- [ ] `dart analyze` reports no issues
- [ ] App compiles successfully
- [ ] No functional changes (only import order)
</verification>

<success_criteria>

- All Dart files have consistent import organization
- dart analyze passes with 0 issues
- No unused imports remain
- App functionality unchanged (imports only, no logic changes)
  </success_criteria>
