<objective>
Remove unused imports and dead code across the codebase.

Purpose: Eliminate unused code that bloats files and creates maintenance burden, improving code clarity and reducing potential confusion.
Output: Clean codebase with no unused imports or dead code.

# Key files from frontmatter (relevant to this phase):
@lib/**/*.dart

**Tech stack available:** dart, flutter, dart analyze
**Established patterns:** Standard Dart/Flutter conventions, lints configured

**Constraining decisions:**
- [Phase 7-01]: Imports now organized (prior plan context)

**Issues being addressed:** Unused imports and dead code (code cleanup)

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Run dart analyze to identify unused imports</name>
  <files>lib/**/*.dart</files>
  <action>Run static analysis to find all unused imports and dead code:

1. Run `dart analyze` to identify unused imports
2. Run `dart fix --dry-run` to see what would be fixed
3. Document all unused imports found
4. Check for unused variables, functions, classes

Create a summary list of files with unused code before fixing.</action>
  <verify>dart analyze output lists specific unused imports and dead code locations</verify>
  <done>List of all files with unused imports/code generated</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Remove unused imports using dart fix</name>
  <files>lib/**/*.dart</files>
  <action>Apply automatic fixes to remove unused imports:

1. Run `dart fix --apply` to auto-remove unused imports
2. Run `dart analyze` again to verify fixes
3. If any unused imports remain, remove manually

DO NOT remove:
- Imports used in comments or documentation
- Imports that appear unused but are used via runtime reflection
- Exports in barrel files (even if "unused" in this file)

Verify app still compiles after fixes.</action>
  <verify>`dart analyze` shows no "unused_import" warnings</verify>
  <done>All unused imports removed, app compiles successfully</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Identify and remove unused private code</name>
  <files>lib/**/*.dart</files>
  <action>Find and remove dead code (private functions, variables, classes that are never referenced):

1. Search for `_private` functions that are never called
2. Look for commented-out code blocks (remove if not needed as documentation)
3. Check for unused class definitions
4. Remove TODO comments that are no longer relevant

**BE CAREFUL:** Private members (_prefix) may be used only in tests - verify by checking test/ directory.

Use grep to find usage before deleting:
- `grep -r "_functionName" lib/ test/`

If zero matches outside definition, it's safe to remove.</action>
  <verify>`dart analyze` passes, all tests still pass, app runs without errors</verify>
  <done>Unused private code removed, no functional changes</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 4: Run full test suite to verify no regressions</name>
  <files>test/**/*.dart</files>
  <action>After removing unused code, run all tests to ensure nothing was accidentally deleted that was needed:

1. Run unit tests: `dart test`
2. Run integration tests: `dart test integration_test/`
3. Run widget tests if any
4. Verify app still runs: `flutter run` (manual check)

If any tests fail, restore the deleted code and investigate why it was needed.</action>
  <verify>All 62+ unit tests pass, integration tests pass, app runs without errors</verify>
  <done>Test suite passes, no regressions from code cleanup</done>
</task>

</tasks>

Before declaring plan complete:
- [ ] `dart analyze` reports no unused imports
- [ ] Unused private code removed
- [ ] Commented-out code cleaned up
- [ ] All tests pass (unit + integration)
- [ ] App compiles and runs successfully
- [ ] No functional changes (only cleanup)
</verification>

<success_criteria>

- Codebase has zero unused imports
- Dead code removed
- All tests still pass
- App functionality unchanged
  </success_criteria>
