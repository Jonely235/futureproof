<objective>
Set up structured logging framework with proper levels and output format.

Purpose: Establish a consistent logging foundation that replaces print statements with structured, level-based logging throughout the codebase.
Output: Configured logging framework with proper levels, formatted output, and logger utility.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create centralized logging utility</name>
  <files>lib/utils/app_logger.dart</files>
  <action>Create AppLogger utility class that provides:
- Static logger instances for different components (UI, Database, Analytics, Services)
- Helper methods for common log patterns (logError, logInfo, logWarning)
- Consistent message formatting with context
- Proper level usage (INFO for normal operations, WARNING for recoverable issues, SEVERE for errors)

DO NOT use print statements in the logger itself - use Logger.log() directly.
This abstraction makes it easier to add file logging, remote logging, or filtering later.</action>
  <verify>File exists at lib/utils/app_logger.dart with AppLogger class containing static loggers and helper methods</verify>
  <done>AppLogger class with component-specific loggers and level-based helper methods</done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Configure logging output format</name>
  <files>lib/main.dart</files>
  <action>Update logging configuration in main() to:
1. Set appropriate log level (Level.INFO instead of Level.ALL for production)
2. Format log output with timestamps and colored level indicators
3. Add emoji prefixes for visual clarity (ℹ️ INFO, ⚠️ WARNING, ❌ SEVERE)
4. Remove duplicate print statements for error/stackTrace (Logger handles this)

DO NOT change the logger.onRecord.listen structure - only improve the formatting within it.
Ensure backward compatibility - existing Logger() calls should still work.</action>
  <verify>flutter run starts without errors, logs appear with improved formatting and emoji indicators</verify>
  <done>Logs display with timestamps, colored levels, and emoji prefixes. Level.INFO set for appropriate verbosity.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Create logging usage documentation</name>
  <files>docs/GUIDES/logging_guide.md</files>
  <action>Create a concise logging guide documenting:
- How to use AppLogger utility
- When to use each log level (INFO, WARNING, SEVERE)
- Common logging patterns for services vs UI
- Examples of proper vs improper logging
- Migration pattern from print() to AppLogger

Keep it brief - one page, actionable examples. Focus on patterns over theory.</action>
  <verify>File exists at docs/GUIDES/logging_guide.md with usage examples and migration patterns</verify>
  <done>Logging guide exists with clear examples and migration guidance from print statements</done>

# Phase 1 Plan 1: Logging Configuration Summary

**Structured logging framework configured with AppLogger utility and improved output formatting**

## Accomplishments

- Created AppLogger utility for centralized logging
- Improved log formatting with emoji prefixes and timestamps
- Set appropriate log levels (INFO for production)
- Documented logging patterns and migration guide

## Files Created/Modified

- `lib/utils/app_logger.dart` - Centralized logging utility
- `lib/main.dart` - Enhanced logging configuration
- `docs/GUIDES/logging_guide.md` - Usage documentation

## Decisions Made

- Use Logger package with AppLogger wrapper for consistency
- Level.INFO for production (not ALL, which is too verbose)
- Emoji prefixes for visual clarity in console output

## Issues Encountered

None

## Next Step

Ready for 01-02-PLAN.md - Replace print statements in services
