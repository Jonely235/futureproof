Before declaring plan complete:
- [ ] flutter run starts without errors
- [ ] grep -r "print(" lib/screens/ returns no results (excluding documentation)
- [ ] All screens function correctly when tested
- [ ] Error messages still display to users (via SnackBar)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- All print statements in screens replaced with AppLogger
- UI layer uses structured logging consistently
- No errors introduced in screen functionality
- User-facing error messages (SnackBar) preserved
</success_criteria>

# Phase 1 Plan 3: Screen Logging Summary

**Replaced print statements with structured logging in all screen files**

## Accomplishments

- SettingsScreen migrated to AppLogger.settings
- HomeScreen migrated to AppLogger.home
- AnalyticsDashboardScreen migrated to AppLogger.analyticsUI
- Complete migration from print() to structured logging

## Files Created/Modified

- `lib/screens/settings_screen.dart` - Replaced print with AppLogger
- `lib/screens/home_screen.dart` - Replaced print with AppLogger
- `lib/screens/analytics_dashboard_screen.dart` - Replaced print with AppLogger

## Decisions Made

- Screen-specific loggers (settings, home, analyticsUI)
- Preserved user-facing error messages (SnackBar)
- Maintained error context in log messages

## Issues Encountered

None

## Next Phase Readiness

✅ Phase 1 (Logging Foundation) complete - all print statements replaced with structured logging
- No blockers for Phase 2 (Constants & Config)
- AppLogger utility available throughout codebase
