1. **Option 1: Downgrade Flutter** (RECOMMENDED)
   - Change 
   - Set  or lower
   - Firebase and plugins work fine
   - Low risk, well-tested try this solution to fix it first then loop 150 times then after one changes then verify it then if fail then continue until 150 times then conclude why still cannot successfully ok every changes need to commit to git too  --complete-promise Done
