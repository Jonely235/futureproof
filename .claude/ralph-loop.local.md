  Quick Overview:

  1. DETAILED_PLAN.md - Strategic roadmap covering:
    - Data persistence with SQLite
    - Transaction history UI
    - Transaction management (edit/delete)
    - Testing, documentation, and polish
  2. TASKS.md - 73 granular, autonomous-ready tasks (15-45 min each):
    - 35 Critical (MVP blockers)
    - 20 Recommended (UX polish)
    - 18 Optional (enhancements)
    - Each includes: steps, code examples, verification, error handling

  Total estimated effort: ~15 hours (5-7 hours for core MVP completion)

  These documents are now ready to hand off to an AI agent (like Ralph) for autonomous execution, or use as your implementation guide --complete-promise DOMEEEEEE
